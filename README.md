Cross-Platform C++ CMake Project Template
=========================================

cmake-init is a copy and paste template, that provides the following features:
 * Cross Platform
  * Windows
  * Linux
  * Mac
 * Libraries, Applications, Testing template
 * Documentation template
 * Installation, Packaging template
 * CMake find script template for defined libraries

The files of cmake-init are an instantiation of the templates containing:
  * Example app
  * Example lib
  * Example test
  * Example documentation
  * Example package

This branch contains a minimal cmake-project without any of the features mentioned above. It also serves as a test for finding and linking to the template library of the main branch via its cmake-config file. For the real stuff, checkout the master branch.
